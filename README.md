# beesbeesbees
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

Bees (the most noble of insects) progress through specific developmental stages over the course of their lifetimes. Each phase has specific traits and behaviors associated with it that are unique to that lifestage. In this repo, you will create bees of many lifestages while practicing the pseudoclassical instantiation pattern, inheritance, and subclassing.

## Goals

* Master pseudoclassical instantiation pattern
* Master inheritance
* Master subclassing

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

```
node 12.16.1
```

### Installing

```
